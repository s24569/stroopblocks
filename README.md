## This was the first project I ever made for HackNC at UNC Chapel Hill

The hackathon in question took place in 2014. I worked on this project with an alumni that studied Psychology. This project was actually more about me teaching him how to do basic coding for web pages and animation. Stroop Blocks is built primarily with jQuery powering all of the animation.

## What is Stroop Blocks?

Stroop Blocks was based on the Stroop Experiments that was mentioned by my partner. The experiment was made with the goal to show how a person can be reeducated. Stroop Blocks shows a series of blocks and forces the player to unlearn the correct names of the colors. For example, the player must learn that the color 'yellow' is now a stand-in for 'red'. After the player has been reeducated then the game comes to a conclusion.
